An arrow made by rotating a square 45 degrees, producing an equilateral triangle. The ::after pseudo-element is used for the square.

```jsx
<Arrow />
```

```html
<div class="Arrow-dYtoUl kFelWz Base-gxTqDr bCPnxv"></div>
```

By default it points down, but you can use the `angle` prop to change it.

```jsx
<Arrow angle={135} />
```

```jsx
<Arrow border="3px solid orange" color="white" angle={195} />
```
